    "text": "Hi, I’m Lily. I grew up in central Texas and have lived in Vermont, Italy, Tennessee, and now Philadelphia. I have a degree in History and still enjoy the occasional historical work, currently diving into Empire of Wealth. I’m a lifelong fan of the San Antonio Spurs and am learning to enjoy the Birds. I also love spending time outdoors, having hiked several of the major US trails, and even climbed Mount Kilimanjaro last year. In my downtime, I enjoy playing video games, from immersive series like The Witcher to cozy games like Stardew Valley. I’m a curious person, seeking answers for questions through experiences with new places, books, outdoor adventures, or games."
